We ignore the warning "date/time input type is not supported in all browser" in the W3C validator because professor mentioned in module 5's page 
that "Your page needs to work in the versions of Firefox and Chrome installed on the lab computers." We made sure that it would work on Firefox and Chrome,
so we didn't bother to fix this warning. We hope our TA would taken this into consideration when grading our assignment. Besides, this problem can only be 
sloved on the javscript side, which wouldn't be reflected in the W3C validator anyway.

Creative portion is exactly like what is described in the grading section of module 5. You can share calendars with other users at the bottom 
of the page after logging in. When a user creates a new event, they can tag it or make it a group event. For example, if you login as jack and share your
calendar with 11, you should be able to see jack's calendar in the "shared calendar" dropdown menu in 11's homepage. However, if you click on share multiple
times, those data would also be saved into the shared calendar database, and the dropdown menu may contain duplicate items because of that. That is not a 
display error. We are just simply too tired to change the database settings, please take pity on us.

Useful users for testing:

User1:
username: 11
password: 1

User2:
username: jack
password: 123
